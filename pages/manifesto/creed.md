# The Creed

AI is not like traditional software.  
It does not unfold in straight lines or predictable steps.  
It is stochastic, generative, and exploratory.  
Certainty is not given at the start. We discover it by building, testing, and comparing.  

That means the way we work must change.  
Old workflows that assume the answer is known in advance will stall.  
Old habits of debate and persuasion will waste time.  
AI requires a new discipline: discovery as the foundation of progress.  

This is the builderâ€™s creed:  

- I wake up in the morning with questions.  
- I build solutions to discover the answers.  
- I share what I learn so others can build faster.  
- I trust the system over the ego.  
- I launch not to finish, but to begin.  

This is not a weakness. It is the strength of working with AI: the chance to turn uncertainty into discovery, and discovery into progress.
