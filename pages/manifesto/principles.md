## Principles — "Proof over persuasion…"

- Proof over persuasion: evidence wins arguments.
- Small bets over big bets: iterate to de-risk.
- Open artifacts over private hunches: write it down.
- Reproducible over impressive: make it rerun, then make it shine.
- Teams over heroes: collective clarity beats individual brilliance.
