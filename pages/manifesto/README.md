# AI Standards Manifesto

The **Manifesto** defines how we work with AI.  
It’s the cultural foundation of this catalog: our creed, our principles, and our pledge.  

Where old workflows assumed certainty, AI demands discovery.  
Where organizations default to argument, AI demands proof.  
Where launches once meant the end, in AI they mark the beginning.

## Structure

The Manifesto is presented in three short pages:

- [**The Creed**](./creed.md) — a builder’s statement of how we approach AI work.  
- [**The Principles**](./principles.md) — six guiding values, each with an explanation.  
- [**The Pledge**](./pledge.md) — a collective commitment to discovery, clarity, and structure.

## Quick Glance

- **Proof over persuasion** — arguments end with evidence.  
- **Additive disagreement over blocking** — conflict creates more paths, not less progress.  
- **Structure over personality** — process decides, not ego.  
- **Clarity over cleverness** — simple names and explicit contracts.  
- **Launch as beginning over launch as end** — shipping is day one, not the finish line.  
- **Efficiency over ego** — we care what works, not who was right.

## Why it matters

This Manifesto is not about how AI works.  
It’s about **how we work with AI** — as teams, as builders, as a community.  

It sets the cultural DNA for every pattern in this catalog.
