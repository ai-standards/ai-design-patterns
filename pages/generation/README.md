# Generation Patterns

Generation patterns describe **how models produce and manage outputs**.  
They answer the question: *how do we turn raw model completions into reliable, evaluable, and useful building blocks?*  

These patterns cover **schemas, context, memory, streaming, and evaluation**.  
They turn stochastic behavior into structured systems that teams can trust, measure, and improve.

## Catalog

### [Deterministic IO](./deterministic-io.md)  
Schema-first prompting. Define contracts for every output so results are testable, reproducible, and debuggable.  

### [Context Ledger](./context-ledger.md)  
Make prompt assembly explicit and auditable. Log what went in and what came out so every generation can be replayed.  

### [Structured Memory](./structured-memory.md)  
Separate short-term context from long-term knowledge. Prevent prompt bloat and improve reliability by treating memory as tiers.  

### [Streaming First](./streaming-first.md)  
Prefer incremental output over monoliths. Improves UX, reduces perceived latency, and creates more responsive systems.  

### [PathScore](./pathscore.md)  
A single-number evaluation metric for comparing paths before merging. Balances value (impact) against cost (tokens, time, eval bill).

## Why Generation Matters

Raw model completions are not enough. Without structure, context discipline, and evaluation, you get demos that can’t be trusted in production.  

Generation patterns provide the **contracts and controls** that transform LLM output into reliable components of a system.  
They make it possible to debug, compare, and evolve — turning chance into discovery, and discovery into progress.
