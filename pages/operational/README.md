# Operations Patterns

Operations patterns describe how AI systems are launched, monitored, and controlled in production.  
They answer the question: *how do we run AI systems safely, reliably, and cost-effectively once they leave development?*  

These patterns cover rollback, rollout, parallel testing, cost control, and observability.  
They give teams the discipline to ship confidently while keeping failures, costs, and risks contained.

## Catalog

### [Rollback Ledger](./rollback-ledger.md)  
Make every launch reversible. Nothing enters production unless it can also be rolled back cleanly.  

### [Canary Tokens](./canary-tokens.md)  
Roll out changes gradually by allocating small slices of traffic or token budgets before scaling system-wide.  

### [Shadow Agents](./shadow-agents.md)  
Test new agents in parallel with production by logging their results invisibly until they are proven.  

### [Cost Guardrails](./cost-guardrails.md)  
Prevent runaway token or compute costs by enforcing explicit budgets and thresholds at every layer.  

### [Telemetry Ledger](./telemetry-ledger.md)  
Record all inputs, outputs, and metadata so behavior can be debugged, audited, and reproduced.

## Why Operations Matter

AI launches are not one-time events. Models drift, costs grow, and failures emerge in production that never appeared in testing.  
Without strong operational patterns, teams are forced to react after the fact â€” scrambling to patch issues, explain regressions, or justify bills.  

Operations patterns ensure that discovery continues safely once systems are live.  
They make launches reversible, experiments measurable, and costs predictable, giving teams the confidence to evolve AI in the real world.
