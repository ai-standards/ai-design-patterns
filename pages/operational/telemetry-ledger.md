# Pattern: Telemetry Ledger

**Intent**: Record all inputs, outputs, and metadata for observability and reproducibility.

---

## Introduction

AI behavior is probabilistic. Failures may appear once and vanish, or successes may be hard to reproduce. Without telemetry, debugging is impossible. The **Telemetry Ledger** pattern solves this by logging every interaction: inputs, outputs, costs, and context.

---

## Problem

- Failures cannot be reproduced without logs.  
- Teams argue about what actually happened.  
- Successes cannot be repeated or studied.  

---

## Forces

- **Privacy vs observability** — logs are valuable but must be handled securely.  
- **Cost vs value** — storing telemetry consumes resources but pays off in insight.  

---

## Solution

- Log every input, output, and context used.  
- Include metadata: timestamp, user/session, model version, token cost.  
- Make logs queryable for debugging and evaluation.  
- Protect sensitive data with access controls.  

---

## Consequences

**Pros**  
- Reproducibility of both successes and failures.  
- Evidence-based debugging and evaluation.  
- Institutional memory of system behavior.  

**Cons**  
- Requires storage, indexing, and security.  
- Logs can become noisy without curation.
