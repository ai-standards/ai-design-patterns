# Governance Patterns

Governance patterns describe how AI teams organize discovery and make decisions.  
They answer the question: *how do we move forward when there is uncertainty, disagreement, or risk?*  

These patterns replace personality-driven debate with structured processes.  
They make sure progress continues, decisions are evidence-based, and history is preserved.

## Catalog

### [Trackâ€“Path Governance](../patterns/governance/track-path-governance/)  
Replace personality-driven debates with structured exploration. Work is organized into tracks (shared goals) and paths (alternative approaches). Evidence determines which path merges back, not ego.  

### [Eval as Contract](../patterns/governance/eval-as-contract/)  
Define evaluation criteria up front so merges are based on evidence, not persuasion. Metrics agreed before work begins prevent shifting goalposts.  

### [Decision Ledger](../patterns/governance/decision-ledger/)  
Preserve the rationale behind decisions so they aren't forgotten or relitigated. A simple log of decisions, dates, and rationale saves teams from repeating old debates.  

### [Lazy Consensus](../patterns/governance/lazy-consensus/)  
Default to progress unless there is strong, constructive objection. Silence means consent; objections must come with a counter-path.

## Why Governance Matters

AI projects move quickly and face constant uncertainty.  
Without governance, disagreements stall progress, merges are political, and history is forgotten.  

Governance patterns provide lightweight structures that keep teams moving, make decisions fair, and preserve institutional memory.  
They ensure discovery does not collapse into endless debate or fragile consensus.
