# Architecture Patterns

Architecture patterns describe **how AI systems are structured**.  
They answer the question: *how do we organize agents, tools, and views so that discovery doesnâ€™t collapse into chaos?*  

These patterns are about **boundaries, contracts, and composition**.  
They ensure that reasoning, orchestration, and presentation stay separate, tools are safe to call, risky actions are isolated, and failures degrade gracefully instead of breaking everything.

## Catalog

### [ACV (Agent / Controller / View)](./acv.md)  
Separate reasoning, orchestration, and presentation to avoid brittle, tangled systems. Agents propose, controllers execute, views render.  

### [Tool Adapter](./tool-adapter.md)  
Wrap volatile or risky tools in strict contracts. Adapters validate, retry, and log so agents only see safe, stable interfaces.  

### [Sandbox-First](./sandbox-first.md)  
Run risky or untrusted actions in isolation before touching production. Dry-runs and mocks protect systems from catastrophic errors.  

### [Fallback Chain](./fallback-chain.md)  
Define ordered alternatives when actions fail. If the primary path breaks, fallbacks ensure the system still delivers results.

## Why Architecture Matters

Without clear architecture, AI projects tend to sprawl into **monolithic hero agents** or **fragile black boxes**.  
These patterns provide the structure to scale: each piece does one job well, is testable on its own, and composes cleanly with the rest.  

Architecture is what makes discovery sustainable.
