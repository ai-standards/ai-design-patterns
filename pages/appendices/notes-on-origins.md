# Notes on Origins

These patterns did not appear in a vacuum. They draw on decades of practice in other fields and adapt them to the realities of AI.

## Influences

- **Design Patterns (1994)** — Gamma et al. gave software a shared vocabulary of solutions.  
- **Agile Manifesto (2001)** — replaced heavyweight process with lightweight principles.  
- **Gitflow (2010)** — showed how branching structures could shape team collaboration.  
- **MLOps Practices (2015–)** — introduced operational discipline to machine learning pipelines.

## AI-Specific Shifts

- **Discovery at the Core** — unlike traditional software, AI work begins in uncertainty. Patterns must support exploration, not only execution.  
- **Stochastic Systems** — LLMs produce variable outputs; determinism must be layered on top.  
- **Token Economy** — cost and efficiency are part of architecture, not afterthoughts.  
- **Governance by Structure** — tracks, paths, and contracts replace personality-driven debates.

## Why Document

Just as earlier fields needed shared language, AI now needs its own. This catalog exists to name the practices that work, warn against those that fail, and make discovery repeatable.
