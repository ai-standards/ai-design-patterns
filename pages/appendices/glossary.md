**Path** — an alternative approach within a track.  
**Merge** — the act of adopting a path into the track as the chosen solution.  
**Agent** — an AI reasoning component that proposes actions.  
**Controller** — the orchestrator that validates and executes actions.  
**View** — the presentation layer that renders state to users.  
**Ledger** — a record of events, inputs, outputs, or decisions for auditability.  
**Contract** — an explicit schema or evaluation criterion.  
**Eval** — a test or metric for judging AI outputs.

## Common Concepts

**Anti-Pattern** — a practice that feels convenient but leads to fragility.  
**Schema** — a structured format that defines valid input or output.  
**Streaming** — producing output incrementally rather than all at once.  
**Sandbox** — an isolated environment for testing risky actions.  
**Fallback** — a predefined backup action when the primary fails.
