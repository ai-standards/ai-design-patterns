# Appendices

The appendices provide supporting material for the catalog.  
They are not patterns themselves, but they explain the background, definitions, and process that make the patterns usable.

## Contents

- [Contribution Guide](./contribution-guide.md) — how to propose new patterns, anti-patterns, or refinements.  
- [Pattern Template](./pattern-template.md) — the structure every pattern follows (Intent, Problem, Forces, Solution, Consequences).  
- [Glossary](./glossary.md) — shared definitions for terms used across the catalog.  
- [Notes on Origins](./notes-on-origins.md) — background on where these patterns came from and how they connect to earlier traditions.
