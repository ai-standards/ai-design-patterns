## How to Contribute

1. **Propose a Pattern**  
   - Use the [pattern template](./pattern-template.md).  
   - Include clear sections: Intent, Problem, Forces, Solution, Consequences.  
   - Submit as a pull request under the correct section (`governance`, `architecture`, `generation`, `operations`, or `anti-patterns`).  

2. **Refine a Pattern**  
   - Suggest edits to clarify language, add examples, or improve structure.  
   - Keep changes focused and evidence-based.  

3. **Add Field Notes**  
   - Share practical examples of applying a pattern.  
   - Link to write-ups, code snippets, or case studies.

## Naming Conventions

- Pattern files are lowercase, words separated by hyphens (e.g. `context-ledger.md`).  
- Anti-patterns begin with a numeric prefix (e.g. `9001-black-box-opaqueness.md`) to distinguish them.  
- Section README files are always `README.md` and render automatically.  

---

## Style Guidelines

- Write in professional, plain language.  
- Use full sentences and clear structure.  
- Avoid jargon unless defined in the [glossary](./glossary.md).  
- Be consistent with existing sections.

## Review Process

- All contributions are reviewed for clarity, consistency, and alignment with the manifesto.  
- Merges are evidence-based, not personal.  
- Objections must be constructive and include alternatives.
