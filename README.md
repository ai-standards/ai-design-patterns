# AI Design Patterns

The way we build with AI is different.  
Uncertainty is the starting point, not the end.  
Discovery is the process, not a side effect.  
To succeed, we need more than intuition — we need shared names, proven structures, and repeatable practices.  

This repository is the open catalog of **AI Design Patterns**, maintained under the [AI Standards](https://github.com/ai-standards) organization.  
It captures what great teams already do, names it, and makes it reusable for everyone.

## Contents

- [Manifesto](./pages/manifesto/)  
  The cultural foundation: our creed, our principles, and our pledge.  

- [Governance](./pages/governance/)  
  How teams organize discovery and make decisions.  
  Patterns: Track–Path Governance, Eval as Contract, Decision Ledger, Lazy Consensus.  

- [Architecture](./pages/architecture/)  
  How systems are structured to avoid chaos.  
  Patterns: ACV (Agent / Controller / View), Tool Adapter, Sandbox-First, Fallback Chain.  

- [Generation](./pages/generation/)  
  How outputs are produced, structured, and evaluated.  
  Patterns: Deterministic IO, Context Ledger, Structured Memory, Streaming First, PathScore.  

- [Operations](./pages/operations/)  
  How AI systems are launched, monitored, and controlled in production.  
  Patterns: Rollback Ledger, Canary Tokens, Shadow Agents, Cost Guardrails, Telemetry Ledger.  

- [Anti-Patterns](./pages/anti-patterns/)  
  What not to do — the traps that feel clever or fast but collapse in practice.  
  Examples: Black-Box Opaqueness, Hero Agent, Infinite Debate, Perma-Beta.

## Why This Matters

Every field has its standards.  
Agile gave us principles.  
Software gave us design patterns.  
AI needs its own language of practice.  

This catalog is not theory. It is **field-tested wisdom**:  
- Discovered through building real AI systems.  
- Captured in names that make sense.  
- Written as patterns so they can be applied and reused.  

The goal is not to tell teams *what* to build, but to give them the **language and structure to build better**.

## How to Contribute

This is a living standard. We welcome contributions:  

- Propose new patterns with clear names, intent, and forces.  
- Add examples and refinements to existing patterns.  
- Suggest anti-patterns to warn others.  
- Share field notes from applying these patterns in practice.  

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./pages/appendices/contribution-guide.md) for guidelines.

### Closing Note

This work is based on discovery.  
We propose paths, not arguments.  
We merge with evidence, not ego.  
We launch to learn, not to finish.  

**AI Design Patterns** is our shared language for making discovery repeatable.
