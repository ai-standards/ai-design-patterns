# TypeScript Example Architecture and Implementation

Welcome to the TypeScript example directory! This README provides an overview of the architecture and design of the example, details on the implementation, and guidance on how to modify or extend the example for your use cases.

## Architecture Overview

This TypeScript example demonstrates a simple application that includes a function and a class, showcasing fundamental concepts such as type safety, error handling, and unit testing. The main components are:

- **Function**: `myFunction` which performs a mathematical operation (squaring a number).
- **Class**: `AnotherClass` which encapsulates a numeric value and provides methods to manipulate and retrieve that value.

The design emphasizes modularity and reusability, allowing developers to easily adapt the components for various scenarios.

## Implementation Details

### 1. The Function: `myFunction`

The `myFunction` is designed to take a numeric input and return its square. It includes error handling to manage non-numeric inputs.

**Example Implementation:**
```typescript
export function myFunction(input: number): number {
    if (typeof input !== 'number') {
        throw new Error('Input must be a number');
    }
    return input * input;
}
```

#### Key Features:
- **Type Safety**: The function accepts only numeric inputs, ensuring type safety at compile time.
- **Error Handling**: Throws an error if the input is not a number, enhancing robustness.

### 2. The Class: `AnotherClass`

`AnotherClass` manages a numeric value and provides methods to interact with it, including updating the value and converting it to a string representation.

**Example Implementation:**
```typescript
export class AnotherClass {
    value: number;

    constructor() {
        this.value = 0; // Default value
    }

    updateValue(newValue: number): void {
        if (newValue < 0) {
            throw new Error('Value cannot be negative');
        }
        this.value = newValue;
    }

    toString(): string {
        return `Value is ${this.value}`;
    }
}
```

#### Key Features:
- **Default Initialization**: The class initializes `value` to 0.
- **Value Validation**: Prevents negative values from being set, ensuring data integrity.

### 3. Testing the Components

The provided test suite uses Jest to validate the functionality of both `myFunction` and `AnotherClass`. 

**Example Test Cases:**
```typescript
describe('myFunction', () => {
    it('should return the correct result for valid input', () => {
        const result = myFunction(5);
        expect(result).toBe(25);
    });

    // Additional tests...
});
```

The tests cover various scenarios, including valid inputs, edge cases, and error conditions, ensuring comprehensive coverage of the functionality.

## Modifying and Extending the Example

You can easily adapt this example for other use cases by following these guidelines:

1. **Extending `myFunction`**:
   - To add more mathematical operations, create additional functions (e.g., `add`, `subtract`) and ensure they follow the same input validation pattern.

2. **Enhancing `AnotherClass`**:
   - Add more properties or methods to `AnotherClass` to manage additional state or provide more functionality (e.g., a method to reset the value).

3. **Adding New Test Cases**:
   - Extend the test suite by adding new test cases for any newly created functions or methods, ensuring all scenarios are covered.

4. **Refactoring for Reusability**:
   - If you find yourself repeating code, consider creating utility functions or base classes that can be reused across different components.

## Conclusion

This TypeScript example serves as a foundation for understanding basic programming concepts in TypeScript, such as type safety, error handling, and testing. By following the structure and patterns demonstrated, you can easily adapt and extend the code to suit more complex use cases. Happy coding!
