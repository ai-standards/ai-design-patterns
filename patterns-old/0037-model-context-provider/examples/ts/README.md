# TypeScript Recommendation System Example

This directory contains a TypeScript example demonstrating a simple recommendation system architecture. The system generates personalized product recommendations based on user preferences, product details, and contextual factors such as the time of day.

## Architecture and Design

The architecture of this example is based on a modular design pattern, employing interfaces and classes to define clear contracts for different context blocks. This allows for a separation of concerns, making the system easier to maintain and extend. The main components of the architecture are:

1. **Context Interfaces**: These define the contracts for different context blocks:
   - `UserProfileContext`: Responsible for retrieving user preferences.
   - `ProductContext`: Responsible for fetching product details.
   - `ContextualFactors`: Responsible for providing contextual information like the time of day.

2. **Context Implementations**: These classes implement the interfaces defined above:
   - `UserProfile`: Returns simulated user preferences.
   - `Product`: Returns simulated product details.
   - `Factors`: Returns the current time of day.

3. **Recommendation Function**: The `createRecommendation` function orchestrates the interaction between the context blocks to generate a personalized recommendation.

4. **Main Function**: The `main` function serves as the entry point of the application, executing the recommendation generation and logging the output.

## Implementation Details

### Context Interfaces

The interfaces ensure that each context block adheres to a specific contract, which enhances code readability and maintainability:

```typescript
interface UserProfileContext {
    getUserPreferences(userId: string): string[];
}

interface ProductContext {
    getProductDetails(productId: string): { name: string; price: number };
}

interface ContextualFactors {
    getTimeOfDay(): string;
}
```

### Context Implementations

Each context class implements its respective interface:

```typescript
class UserProfile implements UserProfileContext {
    getUserPreferences(userId: string): string[] {
        return ["electronics", "books", "clothing"];
    }
}

class Product implements ProductContext {
    getProductDetails(productId: string): { name: string; price: number } {
        return { name: "Smartphone", price: 699 };
    }
}

class Factors implements ContextualFactors {
    getTimeOfDay(): string {
        const date = new Date();
        return date.getHours() < 12 ? "morning" : "afternoon";
    }
}
```

### Creating Recommendations

The `createRecommendation` function integrates the context blocks to generate a personalized recommendation:

```typescript
function createRecommendation(userId: string, productId: string): string {
    const userProfileContext = new UserProfile();
    const productContext = new Product();
    const contextualFactors = new Factors();

    const userPreferences = userProfileContext.getUserPreferences(userId);
    const productDetails = productContext.getProductDetails(productId);
    const timeOfDay = contextualFactors.getTimeOfDay();

    return `Good ${timeOfDay}, based on your interest in ${userPreferences.join(", ")}, we recommend the ${productDetails.name} for $${productDetails.price}.`;
}
```

### Main Function

The main function executes the example, using sample user and product IDs:

```typescript
function main() {
    const userId = "user123";
    const productId = "product456";
    const recommendation = createRecommendation(userId, productId);
    console.log(recommendation);
}

main();
```

## Modifying and Extending the Example

To modify or extend this example for different use cases, consider the following:

1. **Changing User Preferences**: Update the `getUserPreferences` method in the `UserProfile` class to fetch real user preferences, possibly from a database or an API.

2. **Adding More Products**: Extend the `Product` class to include more products, perhaps by using a data structure that holds multiple products and their details.

3. **Enhancing Contextual Factors**: You can add more contextual factors, such as location or user history, by creating additional context classes that implement the relevant interfaces.

4. **Testing**: The provided test code uses Jest to ensure the recommendation logic works correctly. You can extend the test cases to cover additional scenarios, such as different user IDs or product IDs.

By following this modular design, you can easily adapt the recommendation system to fit various requirements and use cases.

## Conclusion

This TypeScript recommendation system example serves as a foundation for building more complex applications that require personalized user interactions. By leveraging interfaces and modular components, the design promotes scalability and maintainability.
