# Pattern: Streaming First

**Intent**: Prefer incremental output over monolithic completions.

## Introduction

In traditional software, responsiveness defines user experience. But in many AI systems, outputs arrive as a single large block after long latency. This creates silence while users wait, hides useful partial progress, and risks wasting effort if the process fails before completion.  

The **Streaming First** pattern flips this by making incremental output the default. Instead of holding results until everything is finished, the system streams tokens or chunks in real time, allowing users (and downstream systems) to act as information arrives.  

- Traditional completions are monolithic and slow  
- Users perceive latency more harshly when nothing happens  
- Streaming creates responsiveness and trust

## Problem

Long waits with no feedback undermine both user experience and system reliability. If a run fails mid-completion, all progress is lost. Without access to partial outputs, downstream processes remain idle, and the user feels the system is unresponsive.  

- Silent waits make latency feel worse  
- Failures waste entire runs  
- No way to act on partial progress

## Forces

Streaming isn’t free — it introduces trade-offs. Incremental outputs improve responsiveness, but they add complexity to pipelines. Partial content must be displayed or processed gracefully, and systems must balance control with flexibility. Costs may rise slightly, but the payoff is a smoother, more trustworthy experience.  

- Responsiveness vs complexity  
- Control vs flexibility  
- Cost vs usability

## Solution

Design systems to stream outputs by default rather than treating it as an afterthought. Interfaces and controllers should be built to handle incomplete state, while users see results as they appear. This approach not only improves responsiveness but also enables early action and failure recovery.  

- Stream outputs as the baseline approach  
- Act on partial results in real time  
- Build interfaces that handle incomplete state

## Consequences

A streaming-first design transforms user expectations. Perceived latency drops dramatically, failures waste less work, and systems gain the ability to act on partial content. The trade-off is added engineering complexity: pipelines must support incremental flow, and partial results often need reconciliation at the end.  

- Pros: better experience, lower perceived latency, early action possible, less wasted work  
- Cons: increased complexity, partial outputs may require reassembly

**Key Insight**: Don’t make users wait in silence. By streaming content progressively, systems become more responsive, trustworthy, and interactive — even when total generation time remains unchanged.
