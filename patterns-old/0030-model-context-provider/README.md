# Model-Context-Provider AI Design Pattern

## Introduction

The Model-Context-Provider (MCP) is an AI design pattern that separates context into composable blocks of intelligence. Its primary purpose is to create a more modular and maintainable AI system by encapsulating specific functionalities within separate models and linking them through a shared context. This pattern is particularly useful in complex AI architectures where different models need to interact and share information.

## When and Why to Use MCP

The MCP pattern becomes especially useful when dealing with large and complex AI systems where multiple models need to interact. It allows for a clear separation of responsibilities, ensuring each model focuses on a particular task, thus increasing maintainability and scalability. It's also beneficial when you need to update or replace individual models, as the changes won't affect the entire system, and you can integrate the new models without disrupting the existing ones.

- Use MCP when you have large and complex AI systems.
- Use MCP when individual models need to interact and share information.
- Use MCP when you need to update or replace models without disrupting the entire system.

## Benefits and Trade-offs

One of the key benefits of the MCP pattern is enhanced modularity. By separating different functionalities into distinct models, you can simplify the design and maintenance process. This pattern also boosts scalability, as you can add, update, or remove models without affecting the system's overall functionality. However, this pattern may introduce complexity in managing the shared context and ensuring proper synchronisation among different models.

- Benefits: Enhanced modularity, simplified maintenance, and improved scalability.
- Trade-offs: Increased complexity in managing shared context and synchronising models.

## Example Use Cases

The MCP pattern can be applied in various AI applications. For instance, in a recommendation system, you can use this pattern to separate the models responsible for user preferences, item categorisation, and user-item interaction. In a natural language processing (NLP) system, different models could handle syntax analysis, semantic analysis, and context generation.

- Example 1: Separating user preference, item categorisation, and user-item interaction models in a recommendation system.
- Example 2: Separating syntax analysis, semantic analysis, and context generation models in an NLP system.

## Implementation Notes

When implementing the MCP pattern, remember that the shared context is the glue holding the different models together. It's crucial to define a robust interface for models to interact with the shared context and ensure the context remains consistent across all models. Also, consider how changes in one model may impact the shared context and consequently affect other models.
