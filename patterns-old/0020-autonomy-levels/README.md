# Autonomy Levels

Define graduated permission tiers for agents, from read-only to fully autonomous, tied to risk and context.

## Intent

Different tasks carry different risks and require different levels of human oversight. Rather than treating all agent actions the same, autonomy levels create explicit permission tiers that match the risk profile of the work being done.

## Problem

Without clear autonomy boundaries, teams face an all-or-nothing choice:
- **Full autonomy**: Agents can do anything, leading to potential chaos
- **No autonomy**: Everything requires human approval, defeating the purpose
- **Unclear boundaries**: Agents don't know what they can/can't do
- **Risk blindness**: High-risk actions treated the same as low-risk ones

## Solution

Define explicit autonomy levels with clear permissions and constraints:

```
Level 0 - Read Only
- Can read data, analyze, and recommend
- Cannot modify anything
- Safe for exploration and analysis

Level 1 - Safe Actions
- Can perform reversible, low-risk actions
- Examples: creating drafts, scheduling meetings
- Automatic logging of all actions

Level 2 - Supervised Actions  
- Can perform higher-risk actions with logging
- Examples: sending emails, updating records
- Human review available but not required

Level 3 - Autonomous Actions
- Can perform most actions independently
- Examples: processing transactions, deploying code
- Human oversight through monitoring and alerts

Level 4 - Full Autonomy
- Can perform any action within domain
- Reserved for highly trusted, well-tested agents
- Comprehensive audit trails required
```

Each level includes:
- **Clear permissions**: What the agent can and cannot do
- **Risk assessment**: Why this level is appropriate
- **Monitoring requirements**: How actions are tracked
- **Escalation paths**: When to involve humans
- **Fallback behavior**: What happens when uncertain

## When to Use

- You have agents performing tasks with varying risk levels
- You need to balance automation benefits with risk management
- Different stakeholders have different comfort levels with automation
- You want to gradually increase agent autonomy as trust builds
- Regulatory or compliance requirements demand clear boundaries

## Implementation

1. **Risk Assessment**: Categorize all potential agent actions by risk
2. **Level Definition**: Map risk categories to autonomy levels
3. **Permission System**: Implement technical controls for each level
4. **Monitoring Setup**: Create appropriate logging and alerting
5. **Escalation Procedures**: Define when and how to involve humans
6. **Regular Review**: Periodically reassess level assignments

## Benefits

- **Risk Management**: Higher-risk actions get appropriate oversight
- **Gradual Trust Building**: Start conservative, increase autonomy over time
- **Clear Boundaries**: Agents know exactly what they can do
- **Stakeholder Comfort**: Different comfort levels accommodated
- **Audit Compliance**: Clear trails for all autonomy decisions

## Example

An AI customer service agent might have:
- **Level 1**: Can create draft responses, schedule callbacks
- **Level 2**: Can send standard responses, update customer records  
- **Level 3**: Can process refunds under $100, escalate complex issues
- **Level 4**: Can handle full resolution including larger refunds (with audit)

The agent automatically operates at the appropriate level based on the task type and context, with clear escalation when it encounters situations outside its current autonomy level.
