# Anti-Pattern: Perma-Beta

**Also known as**: “Endless Experiment,” “Forever Prototype”  
**Intent (gone wrong):** Avoid commitment by keeping everything in “beta” forever.

## Introduction

Discovery is at the core of AI work, but some teams never move beyond it. Every feature, model, or agent is framed as “experimental” — not yet ready, not yet merged, not yet accountable.  

At first, this seems responsible: “we’re iterating, we’re learning.” But without the discipline of merging or killing paths, experiments pile up. The system becomes a collection of half-finished ideas, none of them stable enough to rely on.  

The irony is that a culture of endless beta feels innovative, but it actually paralyzes teams. Users can’t trust the product, builders lose clarity, and decision-makers never see real impact.

## Why teams use it

- **Fear of being wrong** — labeling everything “beta” lowers the stakes.  
- **Perceived speed** — skipping merge criteria feels faster in the moment.  
- **Stakeholder management** — easier to say “still in beta” than commit to hard numbers.  
- **Perfectionism** — belief that with “just one more tweak,” it’ll be ready.

## Pitfalls

- **System instability** — nothing reaches maturity, so the system is fragile end-to-end.  
- **Lost learning** — without merges, history is a blur of abandoned experiments.  
- **Team fatigue** — contributors feel like their work never lands, morale erodes.  
- **User distrust** — customers see an endless parade of half-baked features.  
- **Opportunity cost** — resources are burned on infinite experiments instead of durable value.

## How to avoid it

The escape from Perma-Beta is **decisiveness with evidence.** Every path must have clear evaluation criteria and a deadline. When the criteria are met or the time runs out, the team makes the call: merge or kill.  

This doesn’t kill experimentation — it sharpens it. Experiments gain meaning because they lead somewhere. Builders know their work matters, users gain stable features, and leaders see real impact.  

### Practices
- **Eval upfront** — define success metrics before starting the work.  
- **Time-boxed discovery** — every path has an expiration date.  
- **Merge-or-kill culture** — once criteria are met, make the decision.  
- **Archive abandoned paths** — log them with a one-line reason, so lessons aren’t lost.  
- **Celebrate launches** — treat merges as milestones, not afterthoughts.
