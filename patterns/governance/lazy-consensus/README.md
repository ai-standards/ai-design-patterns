# Pattern: Lazy Consensus

**Intent**: Move forward unless there is strong, constructive objection.

---

## Introduction

Teams often wait for full consensus before acting. In AI, where uncertainty is constant, this leads to paralysis. The **Lazy Consensus** pattern creates a bias toward progress. Silence means agreement. Only explicit, reasoned objections can block, and they must come with a counter-path.

---

## Problem

- Waiting for universal agreement delays progress.  
- Minor objections stall launches.  
- Teams confuse silence with opposition.  

---

## Forces

- **Speed vs inclusivity** — moving fast must not silence valid concerns.  
- **Safety vs autonomy** — objections must be possible, but structured.  

---

## Solution

- Treat silence as consent after a defined period.  
- Require objections to include an alternative path.  
- Move forward unless strong objections are logged.  

---

## Consequences

**Pros**  
- Prevents paralysis by defaulting to progress.  
- Forces objections to be constructive.  
- Reduces unnecessary debate.  

**Cons**  
- Objections may be missed if people are disengaged.  
- Risk of moving too fast if objection windows are too short.
