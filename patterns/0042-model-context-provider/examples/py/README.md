# Python Example Architecture and Implementation

Welcome to the Python example directory! This README provides an overview of the architecture and design of the example, details on the implementation, and guidance on how to modify or extend the example for your use cases.

## Architecture Overview

This Python example demonstrates a simple application that includes a function and a class, showcasing fundamental concepts such as error handling and unit testing. The main components are:

- **Function**: `my_function` which performs a mathematical operation (squaring a number).
- **Class**: `AnotherClass` which encapsulates a numeric value and provides methods to manipulate and retrieve that value.

The design emphasizes modularity and reusability, allowing developers to easily adapt the components for various scenarios.

## Implementation Details

### 1. The Function: `my_function`

The `my_function` is designed to take a numeric input and return its square. It includes error handling to manage non-numeric inputs.

**Example Implementation:**
