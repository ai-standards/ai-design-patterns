# Streaming-First

Streaming-First is a design pattern that prioritizes delivering model output incrementally as it is generated, rather than waiting for a complete response. By streaming tokens, chunks, or typed events, we reduce perceived latency, keep the interface responsive, and enable progressive, real-time user experiences. We treat the interaction as a flow instead of a one-shot request: the user sees useful content early, can cancel when they’ve seen enough, and the system can interleave additional signals (like tool results) as they become available.

We advocate this pattern not merely as an optimization, but as a default posture for AI applications where responsiveness and user trust matter. In practice, Streaming-First unlocks design space for richer interfaces—ghost typing, incremental summaries, real-time voice, and collaborative creation—while also offering practical benefits like lower cost through cancellation and better observability into model behavior.

## When and why to use this pattern

We use Streaming-First whenever the value of early, partial output outweighs the costs of handling incremental updates. It shines in scenarios where responses are long or uncertain in length, where interaction is conversational, or where users benefit from seeing the system “think out loud” in the sense of revealing progress—without exposing sensitive chain-of-thought. If a user’s next action depends on feedback from the model, giving that feedback as soon as it’s available materially improves the loop.

We also choose streaming when network conditions or service latency are variable. A progressive interface that starts showing content in a few hundred milliseconds can feel instant even if the full result takes seconds. Conversely, if we require atomic all-or-nothing responses (for example, strict JSON APIs with transactional semantics), streaming must be adapted carefully or reserved for non-critical presentation layers.

- Use streaming for chat, drafting, coding assistance, retrieval-augmented tasks, tool-using agents, search, and voice or real-time interfaces.
- Avoid streaming as the sole delivery mechanism when clients require fully validated, atomic artifacts; stream previews to the UI while delivering the authoritative artifact at completion.
- Default to streaming for user-facing surfaces; optionally disable for batch, offline, or strict back-end integrations.

## Key benefits and tradeoffs

The benefits of Streaming-First are both experiential and operational. On the experience side, time-to-first-token drops dramatically, leading to higher engagement and trust; on the operational side, users cancel more often when satisfied early, saving tokens and compute. We also gain transparency into progress and better hooks for interleaving tool outputs, telemetry, and guardrails. However, streaming adds complexity across the stack: transport, rendering, safety, and testing must all be designed for partial, evolving state.

- Benefits:
  - Lower perceived latency via early tokens and progressive rendering.
  - Better UX patterns: skeletons, ghost typing, incremental structure, and interleaved tool results.
  - Cost control through user-driven cancellation and adaptive stopping.
  - Real-time modalities (voice, live captions, collaborative editing) become practical.
  - Improved observability: measure time-to-first-token, tokens per second, cancellation rate, and time-to-useful.

- Tradeoffs:
  - More complex infrastructure and client rendering, including backpressure and reconnection handling.
  - Mid-stream error handling and safety moderation are harder than all-at-once responses.
  - Structured outputs are tricky; you must ensure well-formedness or use stream-friendly envelopes.
  - Proxies and load balancers may buffer streams by default; configuration is required to prevent head-of-line blocking.
  - Testing and analytics become event-driven: you’ll need transcript capture and replay, not just final snapshots.

## Example use cases

We lean on Streaming-First across a wide range of AI products. In conversational assistants, ghost typing makes interactions feel natural and alive. In developer tools, streaming code suggestions, compile logs, and quick-fix diffs enable fluid editing. For knowledge work, seeing a summary or outline arrive first and then fill in detail lets users steer sooner and with more confidence. In voice and multimodal experiences, low-latency streaming is table stakes.

- Chat assistants that show tokens as they arrive, with “type ahead” structure (headings, bullets) appearing early.
- IDE copilots that stream code completions, diagnostics, and test results incrementally.
- Search and retrieval experiences that stream snippets and citations first, then explanations and follow-up prompts.
- Agents that stream “actions” and tool results (not private chain-of-thought), so users observe progress and intervene.
- Voice assistants with streaming ASR to text, partial understanding, and low-latency text-to-speech playback.

## Important implementation notes

Adopting Streaming-First touches transport, schema design, rendering, safety, and operations. We recommend starting with a simple, typed event stream and a tolerant renderer, then layering on cancellation, moderation, and observability. When structured outputs matter, prefer stream-friendly envelopes or line-delimited records over raw token streams that must become a single JSON object.

- Transport and framing:
  - Use a streaming transport suited to your platform: Server-Sent Events for simplicity, WebSockets for bidirectional needs, or gRPC for mobile/enterprise. Ensure proxies don’t buffer; configure timeouts, keep-alives, and compression thoughtfully.
  - Define a small, stable event schema (for example: message_start, content_delta, tool_call_start, tool_result, message_end, error, heartbeat). Include ids, ordering, and metadata so clients can reconcile out-of-order or duplicate events.
  - Emit an explicit end-of-stream event with usage and completion reason to simplify accounting and client state.

- Rendering and UX:
  - Build an incremental renderer that can handle partial Markdown and code fences gracefully; finalize formatting on message_end to resolve any dangling constructs.
  - Use progressive disclosure: outline or headings early, then details; show typing indicators and clear “finalized” states. Provide a cancel/stop control that halts generation server-side.
  - For accessibility, update live regions politely and pace streaming for readability; consider batching very small token deltas into readable chunks.

- Structured outputs and tools:
  - For machine-consumed results, prefer NDJSON or typed event envelopes over raw, partial JSON; only emit a final, validated JSON object at completion if strict structure is required.
  - When using tools, stream tool invocation events and results; avoid streaming private chain-of-thought. Stream user-understandable rationales or plans as separate, safe summaries if needed.
  - If you must stream structured content, use grammars or constrained decoding to maintain prefix-validity, or gate the structured artifact until finalization.

- Safety and compliance:
  - Apply moderation pre-, mid-, and post-stream. Be prepared to halt or redact mid-stream if policy triggers. Do not stream sensitive internal reasoning; stream actions, citations, or safe summaries instead.
  - Avoid streaming secrets or sensitive identifiers; implement server-side redaction on deltas before they hit the wire.

- Reliability and performance:
  - Support cancellation and backpressure: surface client aborts to the model, and handle slow consumers without unbounded buffering.
  - Add heartbeats to keep idle connections alive and detect network issues. Implement retry with idempotency keys, and consider resumable streams only if your UX needs it.
  - Instrument TTFT (time to first token), tokens/sec, time-to-useful content, completion reasons, and cancellation rates. Use these to tune decoding parameters and UX pacing.

- Networking and deployment:
  - Disable proxy buffering for streaming endpoints; configure load balancers for long-lived connections. Validate behavior across browsers (EventSource quirks), mobile networks, and corporate proxies.
  - Plan fallbacks: if streaming is unavailable, degrade gracefully to a non-streaming response with a clear progress indicator.

- Testing and analytics:
  - Capture full event transcripts for replay in automated tests; assert both content and timing thresholds (e.g., TTFT budgets).
  - Log per-event metrics and errors, not just final outcomes; this is essential for diagnosing mid-stream issues and UX glitches.

## Summary

Streaming-First is a pragmatic default for modern AI applications. By sending useful work as soon as it is available, we create experiences that feel fast, transparent, and interactive—without sacrificing correctness for final artifacts. With a simple event schema, a tolerant renderer, and thoughtful safety and observability, we can make streaming the backbone of responsive AI products while handling the real-world complexities that come with it.
