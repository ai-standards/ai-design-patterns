# Pattern: Track–Path Governance

**Intent**: Replace personality-driven debates with structured exploration and fair merges.

---

## Introduction

In many AI teams, decisions are made by the loudest voice or stalled by endless debate. This slows discovery and frustrates builders.  

The **Track–Path Governance** pattern introduces a lightweight system of structure. Work is organized into **tracks** (shared goals) and **paths** (alternative approaches). Disagreements don’t block progress — they generate new paths. Evidence, not ego, determines which path merges back into the track.

## Problem

- Disagreements stall progress.  
- Decisions are personal instead of process-driven.  
- Builders feel silenced or overruled by seniority.  
- Experiments lack clear lineage.  

---

## Forces

- **Speed vs fairness** — fast decisions risk bias, fair decisions take structure.  
- **Exploration vs focus** — multiple paths encourage discovery, but need discipline.  
- **Autonomy vs coordination** — builders need freedom without chaos.  

---

## Solution

- Define **tracks** as shared goals.  
- Allow anyone to propose **paths** toward the goal.  
- Merge paths only when evidence meets predefined criteria.  
- Archive abandoned paths with rationale for history.

## Consequences

**Pros**  
- Progress continues even with disagreement.  
- Process, not personality, decides.  
- Creates traceable lineage of decisions.  

**Cons**  
- Requires discipline to maintain structure.  
- Too many paths can fragment focus if not curated.
