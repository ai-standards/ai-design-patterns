# Agent Factory

An Agent Factory is the AI-native version of the classic Factory pattern: a lightweight, declarative way to instantiate AI agents from standardized “recipes.” Instead of hand-wiring model choices, prompts, tools, memory backends, and guardrails in every service, this pattern centralizes the definition and rapidly materializes consistent, policy-compliant agents on demand. It encourages clean separation between what an agent is (its specification) and how it runs (its runtime adapter and infrastructure), which makes teams faster, safer, and more consistent at scale.

## When and why to use it

Use the Agent Factory pattern when many agents must be created quickly and consistently, often with minor variations. It fits well in platforms and applications that need on-the-fly agent construction, reproducible configurations, and clear governance. The factory also helps standardize agents across multiple runtimes or frameworks, so the same recipe can be deployed in different environments without rewriting code.

- Frequent agent instantiation with small differences in persona, tools, or policies.
- Multi-tenant products where each customer or user session requires a tailored agent.
- Experimentation, A/B testing, and canarying of prompts, models, and tool sets.
- Compliance-driven environments that demand consistent guardrails and auditability.
- Orchestrators or workflows that dynamically spawn specialized sub-agents for tasks.

## Key benefits and tradeoffs

This pattern accelerates development and reduces configuration drift by making agents declarative, versioned, and testable. It also improves governance by applying policies and guardrails at creation time. The chief cost is an extra abstraction layer and the need to maintain a recipe schema and adapters that map recipes to concrete runtimes.

- Benefits:
  - Speed: Instantiate agents in milliseconds from a known-good recipe.
  - Consistency: Enforce shared defaults, safety policies, and telemetry across agents.
  - Reuse: Share recipes across services, teams, and environments.
  - Separation of concerns: Keep “what the agent is” independent from “how it runs.”
  - Experimentation: Swap models, prompts, tools, or memory backends safely and quickly.
  - Reproducibility: Version recipes and pin dependencies for deterministic builds.

- Tradeoffs:
  - Abstraction overhead: Requires a recipe schema and a factory layer to maintain.
  - Indirection: Debugging can be harder if failures occur during assembly.
  - Rigidity: A strict schema may slow highly bespoke agent designs.
  - Coupling: Poorly designed recipes can leak runtime specifics and reduce portability.
  - Governance at scale: Versioning, migration, and deprecation policies must be explicit.

## Example use cases

The Agent Factory pattern appears anywhere teams want many consistent agents with controlled variability. Think of it as a template system for agent behaviors plus a safe, repeatable way to materialize those templates into running components.

- Customer support: Personas for billing, tech support, or onboarding, each with scoped tools.
- Data workflows: Spawn specialized analysis agents (SQL, vector search, charting) per job.
- Content operations: Generate product descriptions or localization variants with guardrails.
- Games and simulations: Create NPCs with distinct goals, memory, and environmental tools.
- Internal copilots: Tailor agents to teams (legal, finance, engineering) with role-specific access.
- Multi-tenant SaaS: Per-organization policies, prompts, and tools applied at instantiation.

## Important implementation notes

A robust Agent Factory starts with a clear recipe schema and strict validation. Recipes should capture the agent’s intent (persona, goals), capabilities (tools, memory), operational policies (safety, privacy), and runtime adapter details (framework, model routing). Keep recipes declarative, versioned, and testable. The factory should apply defaults, validate constraints, bind tools securely, and emit telemetry about both build and run phases.

- Define a schema:
  - Core fields: name, version, model, instructions/system prompt, input/output channels.
  - Capabilities: tools (with scopes), memory policy (ttl, visibility, storage), retrieval.
  - Policies: safety/guardrails, data handling, rate limits, cost budgets.
  - Runtime: adapter/framework, timeouts, retries, fallbacks, logging.
- Enforce governance:
  - Validate tool scopes and redact secrets at bind time.
  - Apply safety filters and content policies before the agent accepts tasks.
  - Version recipes; require migrations for breaking changes.
- Support overrides:
  - Allow controlled overrides (e.g., model or temperature) for experiments.
  - Record provenance: base recipe + diff + environment = agent build metadata.
- Build adapters:
  - Map the recipe to concrete runtimes (e.g., different LLM providers or orchestration frameworks).
  - Keep adapters thin; push business logic back into recipes or shared utilities.
- Engineer for scale and reliability:
  - Cache compiled prompts or adapters; warm pools for hot recipes.
  - Make builds idempotent; provide clear, actionable errors on validation failures.
  - Emit metrics and traces for both instantiation and runtime behavior.
  - Add circuit breakers, timeouts, and budget guards to protect upstream services.
- Test and evaluate:
  - Validate schemas with static checks and contract tests.
  - Maintain golden tests for prompts and tools; run evals per recipe version.
  - Gate promotions (e.g., staging to prod) behind evaluation thresholds.

## Minimal recipe and factory sketch

This minimal sketch illustrates the idea. Recipes are declarative; the factory validates and materializes an agent for a chosen runtime. Keep actual code small and focused—this is infrastructure, not business logic.

Recipe (YAML or JSON):
```
name: billing-helper
version: 1.3.0
model:
  provider: "llm-x"
  name: "x-4-mini"
  temperature: 0.2
instructions: |
  You are a helpful billing specialist. Be concise and cite evidence from account data.
inputs:
  - type: text
outputs:
  - type: text
tools:
  - name: "account_lookup"
    scope: ["read:account", "read:invoices"]
  - name: "refund_request"
    scope: ["write:refund"]
memory:
  strategy: "ephemeral"
  ttl_seconds: 900
policies:
  safety: ["no_pii_leakage", "no_financial_advice"]
  data: { pii_redaction: true, jurisdiction: "EU" }
runtime:
  adapter: "generic"
  timeout_ms: 120000
  retries: 1
telemetry:
  trace: true
  sample_rate: 0.1
```

Factory (pseudo-code):
```
function createAgent(recipe, overrides = {}):
    spec = applyDefaultsAndValidate(merge(recipe, overrides))
    adapter = selectAdapter(spec.runtime.adapter)

    tools = []
    for t in spec.tools:
        enforceScopes(t)
        tools.append(bindTool(t))

    guardrails = compilePolicies(spec.policies)
    prompt = compileInstructions(spec.instructions, spec.model)

    agent = adapter.instantiate({
        model: spec.model,
        prompt: prompt,
        tools: tools,
        memory: provisionMemory(spec.memory),
        guardrails: guardrails,
        io: { inputs: spec.inputs, outputs: spec.outputs },
        limits: { timeout: spec.runtime.timeout_ms, retries: spec.runtime.retries }
    })

    emitBuildEvent(spec)
    return agent
```

To register and retrieve agents by ID:
```
registry.register("billing-helper@1.3.0", recipe)
agent = createAgent(registry.get("billing-helper@1.3.0"), { model: { name: "x-4-large" } })
```

## Summary

The Agent Factory pattern turns agent creation into a fast, declarative, and governed operation. It brings the reliability and portability of traditional factories to AI systems by separating specifications from runtimes, promoting reuse, and making experimentation safe. With a clear schema, strict validation, secure tool binding, and strong observability, it becomes straightforward to scale from a handful of agents to a platform capable of producing thousands—consistently and with confidence.
