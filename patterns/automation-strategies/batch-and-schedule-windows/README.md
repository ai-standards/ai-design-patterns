# Batch & Schedule Windows

Run automations at the right cadence and time windows to reduce cost, load, and disruption.

## Intent

Not all automation needs to run immediately. By batching similar tasks and scheduling them for optimal windows, you can reduce costs, minimize system load, and avoid disrupting business operations.

## Problem

Naive automation scheduling creates several issues:
- **Constant interruption**: Automations running during business hours
- **Resource waste**: Small tasks running individually instead of batched
- **Peak load conflicts**: Automations competing with user traffic
- **Cost inefficiency**: Premium-time execution when off-hours would work
- **No coordination**: Multiple automations stepping on each other

## Solution

Strategic scheduling that optimizes for cost, load, and business impact:

```
Task Classification
    ↓
URGENCY ASSESSMENT
- Immediate: Execute now (critical issues)
- Scheduled: Run at optimal time (routine work)
- Batched: Accumulate and process together
    ↓
WINDOW SELECTION
- Business hours: User-facing, high-priority
- Off-hours: Batch processing, maintenance
- Maintenance windows: High-risk operations
- Load-aware: Avoid peak usage times
    ↓
BATCH OPTIMIZATION
- Group similar tasks together
- Optimize resource utilization
- Minimize startup/teardown costs
    ↓
EXECUTION + MONITORING
- Run during assigned windows
- Monitor resource usage and conflicts
- Adjust scheduling based on results
```

Key components:
- **Task Classification**: Categorize by urgency and resource needs
- **Window Management**: Define optimal execution times
- **Batch Grouping**: Combine similar tasks for efficiency
- **Load Monitoring**: Avoid conflicts with business operations
- **Cost Optimization**: Use cheaper off-peak resources

## When to Use

- You have mix of urgent and routine automation tasks
- System resources are constrained during business hours
- Cost varies significantly by execution time
- Tasks can be grouped for efficiency gains
- Need to minimize disruption to user-facing services

## Implementation

1. **Task Classification**: Define urgency and batching criteria
2. **Window Definition**: Establish optimal execution times
3. **Scheduling Engine**: Route tasks to appropriate windows
4. **Batch Processing**: Group and optimize similar tasks
5. **Resource Monitoring**: Track load and adjust schedules
6. **Cost Tracking**: Measure savings from optimized scheduling

## Benefits

- **Cost Reduction**: Use cheaper off-peak resources
- **Performance**: Avoid conflicts with business operations
- **Efficiency**: Batch processing reduces overhead
- **Predictability**: Scheduled maintenance windows
- **Resource Optimization**: Better utilization of available capacity

## Example

**Data Processing Automation Schedule:**

*Task Categories:*
```yaml
immediate_tasks:
  - fraud_detection
  - security_alerts  
  - payment_failures
  execution: "within 30 seconds"
  
scheduled_tasks:
  - user_analytics
  - report_generation
  - data_cleanup
  execution: "next available window"
  
batch_tasks:
  - email_campaigns
  - backup_operations
  - log_processing
  execution: "accumulate and batch"
```

*Execution Windows:*
```yaml
windows:
  business_hours:
    time: "9AM-5PM EST"
    capacity: "30% of resources"
    priority: "user-facing tasks only"
    
  evening_batch:
    time: "6PM-10PM EST" 
    capacity: "80% of resources"
    priority: "scheduled analytics and reports"
    
  overnight_maintenance:
    time: "2AM-6AM EST"
    capacity: "100% of resources"
    priority: "batch processing and maintenance"
    
  weekend_deep_work:
    time: "Saturday 10PM - Sunday 6AM"
    capacity: "100% of resources"
    priority: "heavy batch jobs and migrations"
```

*Scheduling Examples:*

```
Task: Fraud detection alert
Classification: Immediate
Scheduling: Execute now (30 second SLA)

Task: Generate weekly user report  
Classification: Scheduled
Scheduling: Next evening_batch window (6PM today)

Task: Process 10,000 email campaigns
Classification: Batch
Scheduling: Accumulate until overnight_maintenance window
Batching: Group by campaign type and recipient segment

Task: Database migration
Classification: Maintenance
Scheduling: Next weekend_deep_work window
Coordination: Block conflicting automations
```

*Batch Optimization:*
```python
def optimize_email_batch(campaigns):
    # Group by template type for efficiency
    batches = group_by_template(campaigns)
    
    # Optimize send order for deliverability
    for batch in batches:
        batch.sort(key=lambda c: c.recipient_engagement_score, reverse=True)
    
    # Schedule across multiple windows if needed
    return distribute_across_windows(batches, max_batch_size=1000)

def schedule_analytics_jobs(jobs):
    # Sort by resource requirements
    jobs.sort(key=lambda j: j.estimated_cpu_hours)
    
    # Pack efficiently into available windows
    scheduled_windows = []
    current_window_load = 0
    
    for job in jobs:
        if current_window_load + job.cpu_hours <= window_capacity:
            current_window_load += job.cpu_hours
        else:
            # Move to next available window
            scheduled_windows.append(get_next_window())
            current_window_load = job.cpu_hours
            
    return scheduled_windows
```

The system continuously monitors execution patterns and adjusts scheduling to optimize for changing business needs, resource availability, and cost constraints.
