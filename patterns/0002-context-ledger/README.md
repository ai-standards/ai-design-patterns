# Pattern: Context Ledger

**Intent**: Make prompt assembly explicit, auditable, and reproducible.

## Introduction

When working with LLMs, context is everything. Prompts, system messages, retrieved documents, and user history all combine to shape the model’s behavior. Without discipline, the process of assembling that context becomes invisible. As a result, failures cannot be reproduced, and successes cannot be explained.  

The **Context Ledger** pattern treats prompt construction as a transparent, auditable process. Every piece of input is logged in sequence, with clear reasoning for why it was included. By maintaining this ledger, teams gain the ability to understand, replay, and improve their systems with confidence.  

- Context assembly is often hidden and fragile  
- Failures are impossible to reproduce without records  
- A ledger makes prompt building explicit and trustworthy

## Problem

When context is ephemeral, systems become opaque. One run may succeed while the next fails, and nobody can explain why. Debugging turns into guesswork because the inputs that shaped the output are lost. To make matters worse, prompt assembly logic is frequently scattered across codebases, making it nearly impossible to trace how results were produced.  

- Ephemeral context blocks reproducibility  
- Debugging relies on incomplete information  
- Assembly logic is fragmented and inconsistent

## Forces

Capturing context introduces trade-offs. Full transparency can feel slow, but skipping it leads to wasted time later when errors cannot be traced. Storing context adds cost and complexity, yet it unlocks critical observability. And while dynamic context enables flexibility, it must still follow consistent, documented rules to remain reliable.  

- Transparency vs speed  
- Cost vs observability  
- Flexibility vs consistency

## Solution

The answer is to record every component of prompt construction as part of the workflow. A ledger entry should capture not only the assembled prompt but also metadata such as source, timestamp, and responsible agent. Storing the complete context alongside model outputs ensures that any result can later be audited, debugged, or replayed. Over time, these ledgers become a foundation for evaluation, benchmarking, and trust.  

- Record every step of prompt assembly  
- Store assembled context together with outputs  
- Capture metadata like source, order, and time  
- Make ledgers searchable for debugging and evaluation

## Consequences

A context ledger transforms opaque AI behavior into something reproducible and accountable. Failures can be revisited and explained, while successes can be repeated. Evaluation becomes evidence-based, and the system itself is easier to evolve. The trade-offs are that storage must be managed carefully, and sensitive data in the ledger requires strong security practices.  

- Pros: reproducibility, easier debugging, clearer evaluation, accountable behavior  
- Cons: requires storage discipline, may expose sensitive data if not secured

**Key Insight**: Don’t let context remain hidden. By wrapping every generation with context logging, you make failures debuggable, successes repeatable, and your system transparent by design.
